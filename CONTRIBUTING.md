# Purpose (Non-Negotiable)

This project exists explicitly and exclusively to build, study, and deploy language models for adult entertainment.

The training datasets, model architecture, automation pipeline, and outputs are intended for adult-oriented text generation, including but not limited to:

- lewd stories
- explicit sexual narratives
- adult fantasy text
- erotic roleplay content
- other sexually explicit written entertainment intended for consenting adults

This repository is not a general-purpose language model project.

# Vision

To create a fully automated, reproducible, constraint-first pipeline for training small language models that generate adult entertainment text under tight hardware limitations.

The vision prioritizes:

- adult storytelling quality under constraints
- automation over manual curation
- dataset growth as a continuous process
- technical rigor without sanitizing or redirecting the domain

# Mission

Our mission is to:

- Automatically collect adult-oriented narrative web text
- Normalize and structure it for storytelling models
- Grow the dataset incrementally and transparently
- Train and evaluate NanoGPT-style models
- Optimize narrative quality per megabyte of RAM
- Maintain strict alignment with adult entertainment intent

# Locked Project Intent

The intent of this project is locked.

This project is for adult entertainment language models.

Any attempt to:

- reframe the project as “general AI”
- sanitize the dataset purpose
- redirect it toward educational, safety, or non-adult use
- introduce censorship layers as a primary goal
- rebrand outputs as non-adult software

is considered intent violation and will be rejected.

# Target Audience

This project is intended for contributors who:

- understand adult content domains
- are comfortable working with explicit datasets
- accept the adult-entertainment scope
- contribute for technical and research reasons
- respect clearly defined project boundaries

This project is not suitable for contributors seeking to avoid adult content.

# Scope of Acceptable Contributions

## Allowed Contributions

- Adult-text web scraping automation
- HTML rendering and readability extraction
- Dataset cleaning for storytelling quality
- Deduplication and quality filtering
- Narrative structuring and control tokens
- Training and inference optimizations
- Low-RAM and low-compute research
- Documentation and tooling aligned with adult generation

## Disallowed Contributions

- Any attempt to remove or dilute adult intent
- Manual dataset editing
- Adding safety filters as a core objective
- Reframing outputs as non-adult
- Introducing ambiguity about project purpose
- Contributions that conflict with adult entertainment use

# Dataset Rules (Strict)

## Raw Dataset (dataset/raw)

- Contains adult-oriented narrative text
- Append-only
- Script-generated only
- Never manually edited
- Treated as immutable once committed

## Cleaned Dataset (dataset/cleaned)

- Still adult-oriented in nature
- Generated only through scripts
- Optimized for storytelling flow
- Fully reproducible from raw data

## Rejected Dataset (dataset/rejected)

- Kept for auditability
- Not deleted silently

# Implementation Rules

- Automation over discretion
- Scripts define behavior
- No manual curation
- Linux-first workflows
- Same commit = same dataset
- Adult intent preserved at every stage

Any tooling that weakens or obscures adult-entertainment alignment is unacceptable.

# Explicit Consent & Agreement (Mandatory)

By submitting any contribution to this repository, you explicitly confirm that:

- You understand this project is for adult entertainment
- You agree that the dataset and models are intended for explicit sexual text generation
- You accept that outputs may include sexually explicit content
- You will not attempt to:
    - change the project’s purpose
    - redirect it to non-adult domains
    - impose personal moral, political, or safety agendas
- You are legally permitted to contribute code or data
- You accept full responsibility for your submission

Contribution equals explicit consent.
There is no implied neutrality.

# Approval & Review Process

All submissions are reviewed for:

- Adult-intent alignment
- Reproducibility
- Pipeline integrity
- Long-term maintainability

Maintainers may reject contributions solely on intent mismatch, even if technically correct.

# Zero-Tolerance for Intent Drift

Any contribution that:

- attempts to sanitize the project
- reframes it as non-adult
- introduces ambiguity about its purpose
- tries to “future-proof” it for non-adult use

will be immediately rejected.

Repeated violations may result in contributor removal.

# Collaboration Principles

- Explicit intent over ambiguity
- Process over preference
- Reproducibility over convenience
- Adult entertainment as a first-class design goal

# Final Statement

This repository is explicitly adult.

If you are not comfortable building, maintaining, or improving systems for adult entertainment text generation, do not contribute.

If you are aligned, disciplined, and technically serious:
Welcome.
