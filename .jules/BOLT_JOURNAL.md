# ⚡ Bolt's Journal: Findings & Architectural Log

This journal is maintained by the **Bolt** persona. It serves as a log for:

-   **Empirical benchmarks:** Performance measurements before and after optimizations.
-   **Architectural decisions:** The "why" behind significant code structure changes.
-   **Failed experiments:** Lessons learned from approaches that didn't work.
-   **Statistical truths:** Data-driven observations about the model or dataset.

The goal is to create a persistent, long-term memory of the project's technical evolution, ensuring that decisions are documented and repeatable.
