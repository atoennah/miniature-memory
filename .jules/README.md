# .jules/ Directory: Project Memory & Agent Governance

This directory is the central nervous system for the `miniature-memory` project. It contains all the documentation, rules, and historical context necessary for agents and humans to contribute effectively and in alignment with the project's locked intent.

It is considered a canonical source of truth. **Do not modify files in this directory without explicit BDFL approval.**

## What's Inside?

-   [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md): Defines the roles, responsibilities, and authority of the 3-Agent governance model (Builder, Curator, BDFL) and the specialized operational personas (Bolt, The Archivist). **This is required reading for all contributors.**

-   [`BOLT_JOURNAL.md`](./BOLT_JOURNAL.md): A scientific log of all major architectural decisions, performance benchmarks, and philosophical refactors. If you want to know *why* a core component was changed, the answer is in here, with data to back it up.

## Purpose

The purpose of this directory is to serve as the project's long-term memory. It is the "cache for the human brain."

-   **For Developers:** It provides the context needed to understand our design philosophy, our constraints, and our strict governance model without having to re-read the entire codebase.
-   **For Agents:** It provides the grounding documents that define their roles, constrain their behavior, and ensure their actions are always aligned with the project's goals.

Before starting any significant work, consult the documents in this directory to ensure your contribution is aligned and informed.
