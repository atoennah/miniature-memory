The old man sat by the window, watching the rain fall. It had been raining for days, a steady, relentless downpour that turned the world to shades of gray. He remembered a time when the rain was a welcome sight, a promise of life and growth. Now, it was just another reminder of the world outside, a world he no longer felt a part of.

His daughter had brought him a new book, a collection of short stories by a modern author. He'd read a few pages, but the words felt hollow, the characters distant and unreal. He preferred the stories of his own past, the memories that flickered like old films in the back of his mind. He remembered the smell of his wife's baking, the sound of his son's laughter, the warmth of the sun on his face as he worked in the fields.

These were the stories that mattered, the ones that had shaped him. He closed his eyes and let the memories wash over him, a gentle tide against the shore of the present. The rain continued to fall, but in his mind, the sun was shining.
