# [INJECTOR: THE PHILOSOPHY OF A FROM-SCRATCH GPT]
#
# This file is the pedagogical core of a from-scratch GPT implementation. Its purpose
# is not just to be functional, but to be exceptionally clear and educational. We build
# every core component of the Transformer architecture (as described in "Attention Is All
# You Need") from basic PyTorch primitives.
#
# The hierarchy of the model is as follows:
# 1.  GPT (The full model)
#       - Manages token and positional embeddings.
#       - Contains a stack of Transformer Blocks.
#       - Ends with a layer normalization and a linear layer to produce logits.
#
# 2.  Block (A single Transformer layer)
#       - Encapsulates one Multi-Head Causal Self-Attention module and one MLP.
#       - Employs residual connections ("shortcuts") around both sub-modules, which is
#         critical for training very deep networks.
#
# 3.  CausalSelfAttention (The heart of the Transformer)
#       - Implements Multi-Head Scaled Dot-Product Attention.
#       - A causal mask is applied to ensure that the model is autoregressive (i.e.,
#         predictions for a given token can only depend on previous tokens).
#
# 4.  MLP (Feed-Forward Network)
#       - A simple two-layer feed-forward network with a GELU activation function.
#       - This component is responsible for much of the "thinking" or feature extraction
#         in each Transformer block.
#
# Every design choice here prioritizes clarity over optimization, making it an ideal
# resource for studying the internal mechanics of a language model.

    # [INJECTOR: THE LOGOS OF SELF-ATTENTION]
    #
    # At the heart of the Transformer is the ability to weigh the importance of different
    # tokens in a sequence when producing a representation for a specific token. This
    # mechanism is called Self-Attention.
    #
    # The formula for Scaled Dot-Product Attention is:
    #   Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax( (Q @ K.T) / sqrt(d_k) ) @ V
    #
    # Breakdown of the components:
    # 1.  Q (Query): A projection of the current token's embedding. It's the "question"
    #     it asks of other tokens: "What information do you have that is relevant to me?"
    # 2.  K (Key): A projection of every token's embedding in the sequence. It's the "label"
    #     or "identifier" for each token, advertising its contents.
    # 3.  V (Value): Another projection of every token's embedding. It contains the actual
    #     information that a token holds.
    #
    # The process:
    # -   (Q @ K.T): The dot product between the Query of one token and the Keys of all
    #     other tokens measures their "similarity" or "resonance". A high value means
    #     the key's token is highly relevant to the query's token.
    # -   / sqrt(d_k): This is a critical scaling factor. `d_k` is the dimension of the
    #     key vectors. Without this scaling, the dot products can become very large,
    #     pushing the softmax function into regions where its gradients are tiny. This
    #     would kill the learning process. This scaling keeps the variance of the dot
    #     products at 1, stabilizing training.
    # -   softmax(...): This turns the raw similarity scores into a probability
    #     distribution (a set of weights that sum to 1). A token with a high score
    #     gets a high weight, and vice-versa.
    # -   ... @ V: The final output is a weighted sum of the Value vectors. Tokens
    #     deemed more relevant (with higher softmax weights) contribute more of their
    #     "value" to the final representation of the current token.
    #
    # Causal Masking (`is_causal=True`):
    # For a language model that predicts the next token, we must prevent it from "cheating"
    # by looking at future tokens. The causal mask is an operation that adds -infinity
    # to the attention scores for all tokens that come *after* the current token. When
    # the softmax is applied, these -infinity scores become zero, effectively masking out
    # any information from the future.

        # representational subspaces at different positions.
        #
        # The tensor transformations below are the key to making this efficient.
        # Let's break down the journey of the Key tensor `k`:
        #
        # 1.  Initial shape of `k`: `(B, T, C)`
        #     - B = Batch size (number of sequences processed at once)
        #     - T = Sequence length (e.g., `block_size`)
        #     - C = Embedding dimension (`n_embd`)
        #
        # 2.  `k.view(B, T, self.n_head, C // self.n_head)`
        #     - This reshapes the tensor without changing its data. We are splitting the
        #       embedding dimension `C` into `n_head` smaller chunks.
        #     - `hs = C // self.n_head` is the "head size".
        #     - New shape: `(B, T, nh, hs)` where `nh` is `n_head`.
        #     - This logically groups the embeddings for each head, but they are still
        #       interleaved in memory.
        #
        # 3.  `.transpose(1, 2)`
        #     - This is the crucial step. We swap the sequence length dimension (T) with
        #       the number of heads dimension (nh).
        #     - New shape: `(B, nh, T, hs)`
        #     - Why? The `scaled_dot_product_attention` function expects the heads to
        #       be in the "batch" dimension. By rearranging the tensor this way, we
        #       create a batch of `B * nh` attention problems, each of size `(T, hs)`.
        #       PyTorch's optimized kernel can then process all these heads in parallel,
        #       which is massively faster than looping through them.

class Block(nn.Module):
    # [INJECTOR: THE ARCHITECTURE OF A TRANSFORMER BLOCK]
    #
    # A Transformer is essentially a deep stack of these "Block" modules. The depth is
    # what allows the model to build up progressively more abstract and complex
    # representations of the input text. However, training very deep neural networks is
    # notoriously difficult due to the "vanishing gradient" problem.
    #
    # Two key architectural innovations in this block make it possible:
    #
    # 1.  Residual Connections (The `+` in `x + self.attn(...)`):
    #     This is also known as a "skip connection". Instead of forcing the output of a
    #     sub-layer (like attention or the MLP) to represent the *entire* desired output,
    #     we only ask it to learn the *residual* or the *change* from the input.
    #     The input `x` is passed directly through (the "skip") and added to the output
    #     of the sub-layer. This creates a direct, unimpeded path for gradients to flow
    #     back through the network during backpropagation. Without this, gradients would
    #     have to flow through many layers of non-linear transformations, diminishing
    #     at each step until they become too small to effectively update the weights of
    #     the earliest layers.
    #
    # 2.  Pre-Layer Normalization (The `ln_1` and `ln_2` before Attention/MLP):
    #     Layer Normalization stabilizes the training process by normalizing the inputs
    #     to each sub-layer. It ensures that the mean of the inputs is 0 and the standard
    #     deviation is 1. By placing it *before* the main operations (Attention and MLP),
    #     we adopt the "Pre-LN" architecture. This has been found to be more stable and
    #     effective for training very deep Transformers than the original "Post-LN"
    #     variant where normalization was applied after the residual connection.

        #
        # Why do this?
        # 1.  Parameter Efficiency: This is the most significant benefit. It dramatically
        #     reduces the number of parameters in the model, as the `lm_head` no longer
        #     needs its own large weight matrix. For a vocabulary of 50,000 and an

        #     calculated on output. This has been shown to improve the performance of

    #
    # The current implementation of the `generate` method is simple and correct, but it is
    # extremely inefficient. For every single new token generated, it recomputes the
    # entire attention mechanism for all tokens in the sequence, including all previous
    # ones. This is computationally wasteful.
    #
    # Consider generating the 100th token. The Key (K) and Value (V) matrices for the
    # first 99 tokens have already been computed in the previous 99 steps. There is no
    # need to re-calculate them.
    #
    # The Solution: The Key-Value (KV) Cache
    # A KV cache is an optimization that stores the computed K and V tensors from previous
    # forward passes. When generating the next token, we can reuse these cached tensors
    # instead of recomputing them.
    #
    # How it would be implemented:
    # 1.  Modify `CausalSelfAttention.forward`:
    #     - It should accept an optional `past_kv` argument (a tuple of key and value tensors).
    #     - It should return the newly computed `(k, v)` pair for the current token, along
    #       with the attention output.
    #
    # 2.  Modify `Block.forward`:
    #     - It needs to accept and thread the `past_kv` cache through to its attention layer.
    #     - It should return the updated `(k, v)` cache from the attention layer.
    #
    # 3.  Modify `GPT.forward`:
    #     - It would need to manage a list of `past_kv` caches, one for each `Block`.
    #     - It would pass the appropriate cache to each block in the forward pass.
    #     - It would return the full, updated cache.
    #
    # 4.  Modify `GPT.generate`:
    #     - Before the generation loop, initialize an empty `past_kv` cache.
    #     - In the loop, when calling the model, pass in only the *newest* token and the
    #       `past_kv` cache.
    #     - The model would then efficiently compute attention for just the new token,
    #       using the cached keys and values from all previous tokens.
    #     - Update the `past_kv` cache with the new key and value returned by the model.
    #
    # This optimization is not a minor tweak; it is a fundamental architectural change
    # that can speed up inference by orders of magnitude, transforming the model from a

            # Standard sampling methods like greedy decoding (always picking the most likely
            # token) can lead to repetitive and deterministic text. Random sampling from the
            # entire probability distribution can produce incoherent nonsense. Nucleus sampling
            # offers a powerful compromise.
            #
            # The core idea is to sample from a truncated, dynamically-sized set of the most
            # probable next tokens, called the "nucleus." This nucleus is defined by a
            # cumulative probability threshold, `top_p`.
            #
            # How it works:
            # 1.  Sort Tokens by Probability: After calculating the softmax of the logits,
            #     we sort the vocabulary in descending order of probability.
            # 2.  Calculate Cumulative Probability: We compute the cumulative sum of these
            #     sorted probabilities.
            # 3.  Form the Nucleus: We find the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative
            #     probability is greater than or equal to `top_p`. All other tokens outside
            #     this nucleus are discarded.
            # 4.  Renormalize and Sample: The probabilities of the tokens within the nucleus
            #     are rescaled so they sum to 1. We then sample from this smaller,
            #     higher-quality distribution.
            #
            # Why is this effective?
            # -   Adaptability: If the model is very confident about the next token (e.g.,
            #     after "San Francisco," the probability of "is" is high), the nucleus will
            #     be very small, leading to a near-deterministic choice. If the model is
            #     uncertain, the nucleus will be larger, allowing for more creativity and
            #     diversity while still filtering out the most absurd options.
            # -   Avoids "Tails": It prevents the model from picking highly improbable tokens
            #     from the long tail of the probability distribution, which is a common
            #     source of nonsensical output.
